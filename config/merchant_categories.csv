# Custom Merchant Categorization Rules
#
# Add your custom rules here. These override the ~700 built-in rules.
# Format: Pattern,Merchant,Category,Subcategory
#
# - Pattern: Python regex (case-insensitive) matched against transaction descriptions
# - Use | for alternatives: DELTA|SOUTHWEST matches either
# - Use (?!...) for negative lookahead: UBER\s(?!EATS) excludes Uber Eats
# - Test patterns at regex101.com (Python flavor)
#
# First match wins - your rules are checked before built-in rules.
# Run: budget-analyze inspect <file> to see your transaction descriptions.
#
# Examples:
#   MY LOCAL BAKERY,My Favorite Bakery,Food,Restaurant
#   JOHNS PLUMBING,John's Plumbing,Bills,Home Repair
#   ZELLE.*JANE,Jane (Babysitter),Personal,Childcare
